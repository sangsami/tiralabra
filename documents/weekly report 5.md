# Weekly report 5

## What have I done this week?

Added file handling to the project. Now the program saves the keys and encrypted message to text files. 
Now the user can technically use their own keys to encrypt and decrypt.

## How has the program progressed?

Functionally, everything is done except for padding. Right now it only goes string -> byte array -> BigInteger.
File handling also can't catch all errors and filenames are hardcoded, but those _should_ be easy fixes (hopefully).

## What did I learn this week / today?

Handling files is a misery.

## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly because you will get help from this section if needed.

File handlling took so much trouble that didn't have time to do much else

## What will I do next?

Finish rest of the documentation, performance analysis and tests.


### Time used this week: 15h
