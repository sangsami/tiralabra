# Weekly report 3

## What have I done this week?

Keygenerator is working and have checked from other sources (online primality checkers) that they are (probable) primes. Started on encypters and decrypters, right now they only work on integers, next steps are to turn plaintext to cipher by padding.

## How has the program progressed?

I think the core component is now done. Code style is not very elegant and will need refactoring/comments. Tests are missing, key generating and validating results took longer than expected.

## What did I learn this week / today?


## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly because you will get help from this section if needed.

Same as last week, generating a probable prime number was hard. Also generating a coprime was also suprisingly troublesome. Right now key generating is kind of slow, don't know if possible to optimize.

Some unclear thoughts: how to do a unit test for validating prime numbers (if is necessary)?

## What will I do next?

Finish the whole functionality, implement tests, comment/clean/refactor code

### Time used this week: 20h
