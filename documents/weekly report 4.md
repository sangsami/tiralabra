# Weekly report 4

## What have I done this week?

Refactored the code, cleaned up for checkstyle, added javadoc comments and improved UI. Text to cipher is working now, tried to implement OAEP padding but haven't progressed very far yet.

## How has the program progressed?

Code has been refactored, tests are still lacking, checkstyle almost passing, core functionality of tool done (create keys -> take plaintext input -> encrypt it with public key -> decrypt it with private key)


## What did I learn this week / today?


## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly because you will get help from this section if needed.


## What will I do next?

Complete tests, have code coverage updating, make it so keys and data are saved to a file. Access keys and data from files. 
Generating keys is super slow, thinking about maybe hardcoding some small prime numbers to speed up validating them.


### Time used this week: ~20h
