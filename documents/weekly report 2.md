# Weekly report 2

## What have I done this week?

More research on how RSA-algorithm worked. Started coding the key generator but having trouble to validate that the generated number is a prime, seems like my Miller-Rabin test doesn't work properly.


## How has the program progressed?

Key generator started but stuck on making prime numbers.

## What did I learn this week / today?

RSA is bad for encrypting text and usually there's a hybrid system like AES+RSA. Plain text RSA-encrypting is not secure and OAEP padding should always be used with it.


## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly because you will get help from this section if needed.

Creating own primes that are big enough has been proven to be difficult.

## What will I do next?

Finish key generator and encrypting/decrypting portion.


### Time used this week: 12 hours
