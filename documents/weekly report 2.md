# Weekly report 2

## What have I done this week?

More research on how RSA-algorithm worked. Started coding.

## How has the program progressed?


## What did I learn this week / today?

RSA is bad for encrypting text and usually there's a hybrid system like AES+RSA. Plain text RSA-encrypting is not secure and OAEP padding should always be used with it.


## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly because you will get help from this section if needed.

Creating own primes that are big enough has been proven to be difficult.

## What will I do next?


### Time used this week: 12 hours
