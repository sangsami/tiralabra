# Testing document

## Perfomance analysis

TBD, but right now key creation very slow

## Unit tests

Right now unit tests implemented for classes:

* KeyGenerator
* Decrypt
* Encrypt

Code coverage percentage is low but only because not every class has yet been tested, overall code covera is pretty good for classes that have unit tests
